ATLAS-1.0: Atmospheric Lagrangian Dispersion Model for tephra transport and deposition
Reckziegel Florencia, Folch Arnau & Viramonte Jos√©.

ATLAS (Atmospheric Lagrangian dispersion) is an atmospheric dispersion model tailored to volcanic tephra/ash particles.
Using the Advection-Diiffusion-Sedimentation equation, ATLAS describes the plume dispersion and sedimentation, and calculates
load and concentrations isopach. The model could be run in differnt scales (regional to global), with different off-line
numerical weather prediction models, even in combination. 
ATAS can be used in forward mode (to forectast the ash dispersal from a volcano or to describe a past eruption)
or backward in time (to constrain unknown source term characteristics). Multiple source terms can be defined, with different
granulometric characteritics, in the same simulation.

Detailed information on installing, configuring and using of ATLAS is
reported in the ATLAS User Manual available in directory Manual.
